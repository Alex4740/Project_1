### General Report
- Last day before presentation, Jeny is a bit nervous
- Alex has some confusion on End to End test
- Lesley is all done with API and postman, and ready to help finish the End to End test

### Blockers
- Lesley can't seem to work out the bug after the deleteion of a ticket and then call on the view ticket method (Not even Eric could figure this one out)
- Jeny still having problems completing the coding challanges
- Alex doesn't know how to write the environment for the End to End tests ( went over it all as a group, using the examples from the previous lecture.)
